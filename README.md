Paper of the [slcon2](http://suckless.org/conference/): http://klemkow.net/sj.pdf

## Goals

The XMPP protocol is a monster and totally over engineered.  But you have to
deal with it cause of its wide usages and good features.  To beat this monster
this project try to dived it intro smaller parts and to create one program
to handle one aspect of XMPP.

The program "sj" just do a few things:

  * opens a connection with an XMPP server
  * do authentication (+binding +session registration)
  * perfoms keep-alive pings to the server
  * segmenting tags and routing them to other daemons:
    * presenced
    * messaged
    * iqd

## requires

  * mxml 2.8
  * libbsd (for GNU-systems like Linux)
  * [ucspi-tcp](http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp.html)
  * [ucspi-tools](https://github.com/younix/ucspi)

## usage

```sh
# set base directory
export SJ_DIR=/home/user/.xmpp

# start daemon
tcpclient server.org 5222 sj -u user -s server.org -r resources &
password:

# set presence to 'online'
presence

# add a contact to your roster
roster -a other@server.com -n joe

# subscribe his online status
presence -to other@server.com subscribe

# let him see your online status
presence -to other@server.com subscribed

# view buddies on your roster
roster
other@server.org                both    joe
```

## tested with

   * gcc 4.2.1
   * gcc 4.8.2
   * clang 3.5
 * MacOSX
 * GNU/Linux
   * gcc (Debian 4.7.2-5)
   * clang (Debian 3.0-6.2)

## build

 * git clone https://github.com/younix/sj.git
 * cd sj
 * git submodule init
 * git submodule update
 * make
